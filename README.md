Google Analytics for Gravity Forms
=================

Wordpress plugin to hook google analytics event tracking to Gravity Forms submissions. Credit to <a href="http://www.nvisionsolutions.ca/gravity-forms-scalable-event-tracking-google-analytics/">nvisionsolutions.ca</a> for the source.

Updated for non-UA tracking as well.

Notes:

* Will not track events when form uses page redirect confirmation.
* Will not track events when form uses text confirmation message UNLESS ajax is specified when form is embedded.
